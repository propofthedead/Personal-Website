<h2>Who am I?</h2>


<p>I am Foster Stulen the thrid, yes the thrid as in my dad name was Foster Stulen and my grandfather's name is Foster Stulen. I am currently
  21 years old as I was borned on Apirl 8th in 1997. I am currently a graduate of the Cincy Code IT .Net Technical Bootcamp, that is looking 
  for work to further devolop my skills as a Full stack developer in the .Net workshop and over workshops. I am eager to learn and always looking
  for something new to tackle and bring into my skill set.

  I am open to going to different places if there is a case to move somewhere to have a better oppurtunity although I would prefer to stay in
  the United States for now or at least have some time before the move to another country to possibly learn the lagunages if I need to.
